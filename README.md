**Project Name: Manuscript**
The project was to design a web page that combines a chosen design reading with our written response in Fall 2025 | Typography and Interaction Design 1.
It focuses on applying fundamental HTML and CSS skills alongside principles of typography with constraints given in the project.

*Key things I have learned:*
- Setting up GitHub, Visual Studio Code and Live Preview
- Structuring content with basic HTML elements
- Styling elements with CSS fundamentals
- Applying the box model to control spacing
- Embedding and using fonts from Google Fonts
- Implementing a reset.css file to standardize styles across browsers
