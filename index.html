                "Given that data is the new currency, the internet of things is an epic power grab by the lords of the network—Sterling focuses on the “big five” of Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft—to gain control of as much human data as physically possible.  As the primary interface of the internet of things, the smart home is effectively the tendrils of the network rising out of the ground and into every one of our household appliances to allow mass data collection and digital surveillance"

                My Response:
            </h2>
            <p>
                While the author argues that smart homes are less about convenience, but more about control and surveillance, I consider smart homes are not distortion, but continuation of one of the greatest achievements in humanity. For sure, this alarming mass data collection has countless dangers, so is its potential. We can always whine about how the big tech companies are selling our data, and the fact that privacy is shrinking day by day. Though, let’s take a moment to reflect on its promise: voice assistants that let people with disabilities communicate with the world, smart locks that let parents check on if their children made home safely, and fall detectors that alert caregivers when an elderly parent is in danger. Needless to say, I gave only three examples.

                As mathematician Clive Humby noted back in 2006, “data is the new oil,” a resource that can be refined into immense value, but concentrated in the hands of those who control it. Oil once gave us efficiency, wealth, and comfort but, in return, it left us pollution, dependency, and geopolitical conflict. Yet, no one argues we’d be better off without it. The air conditioning, which McGuirk claims inarguably one of the biggest domestic revolutions, is once built on the modern infrastructure fueled by “oil.” A smart home has countless number of smarter benefits. I believe it’s another industrial revolution, another moment when power shifts. And as always, the choice is to adapt and go on, or to be left behind by those who already are.
