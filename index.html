			<h2>Intro to Smart&nbsp;Home</h2>
			<p>
				For the first time since the mid-twentieth century—with its labor-saving household appliances and rising quality of life—the domestic is once again the site of radical change. And though domestic space appears to fall within the realm of architecture, architects themselves have been almost mute on the implications of such change.
			</p>
			<p class="bolded-text">
					Architecture, it seems, has given up its dreams of imagining how we might live, and so into that
					void technology is rushing.
			</p>
			<p>
				That tired old trope of <span class="highlight">“the house of the future”</span> has been replaced by
				what is now called the “smart home.” The smart home is the network’s great white hope for ubiquitous
				connectivity. It sounds benign enough, and may conjure Jacques Tati-style mise-en-scènes populated
				by absurd devices—the smart home is prime territory for farce—but it is also an ideology. It is the
				house-shaped manifestation of the internet of things, according to which all our devices and
				appliances will join the network, communicating with us and each other.
			</p>
				<p>
					To say that the internet of things is an ideology is to suggest that the use-value of the concept
					has yet to be sold to the consumer. It is easily mocked by skeptical hacks who question the need for
					talking fridges and washing machines that you can program with your smartphone ("You still need to
					put the clothes in yourself, right?"). Bruce Sterling argues that the internet of things has <span
						class="highlight">nothing to do with the consumer</span> and everything to do with the business
					interests of the service providers.

				<h2>Digital Surveillance</h2>
			</div>

				<p class="bolded-text">
					Given that data is the new currency,
				</p>
				<p>
					the internet of things is an epic power grab by the lords of the network—Sterling focuses on the
					<span class="highlight">"big" five”</span> of Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft—to gain
					control of as much human data as physically possible. As the primary interface of the internet of
					things, the smart home is effectively the tendrils of the network rising out of the ground and into
					every one of our household appliances to allow mass data collection and digital surveillance.
				</p>
				<p>
					So are we in danger of overlooking a similar technical detail when it comes to the internet of
					things and the smart home? After all, before revolutionizing architecture, air-conditioning was slow
					to catch on (introduced first in factories and then in cinemas, where it was most cost effective).
					But there is one salient difference.
				</p>

				<p class="bolded-text">
					When air-conditioning finally took off as a domestic revolution, after the Second World War,
					millions and millions of consumers knew exactly why they wanted it. One cannot yet say the same of
					the smart home.

				<h2>Multi-billion Dollar Industry</h2>

					Just What Is It That Makes Today’s Homes So Different, So Unnerving? The internet-of-things evangelists proclaim that it is that most “disruptive” of phenomena: <span class="highlight">a paradigm shift.</span> Bearing in mind Banham’s assertion that electrification was “the greatest environmental revolution in human history since the domestication of fire,” one naturally looks for equivalent consequences when it is claimed (no doubt accurately).
				</p>
				<p class="bolded-text">
					The network is the new electricity. So just how, exactly, will the internet of things revolutionize
					domestic life?
				</p>
				<p>
					The proposals to sell this revolution to the consumer are myriad and many splendored. But perhaps
					the poster product of this new domestic landscape is the Nest smart thermostat, which not only tells
					you exactly how much energy you’re using but can also learn your energy-use patterns and adjust
					itself according to your established preferences. The ostensible motive is environmental
					sustainability—Nest is helping us be better planetary citizens. But of course the reason why Nest
					was purchased by Google is that its smart thermostat is also a data hoover—a point we shall return
					to later.
				</p>
				<p>
					The potential applications of the domestic internet of things cover a whole array of
					multi-billion-dollar industries, from security and healthcare to lifestyle and gaming. Thus
					Microsoft is developing kitchen counters that can recognize foodstuffs and display appropriate
					recipes. There are smart mattresses that monitor your sleep patterns by measuring your breathing and
					your heart rate. There are any number of smart locks now available that open when you walk up to the
					door and that can be programmed to let in your friends or guests (perfect for the Airbnb
					generation). There is cautious excitement about the potential of <span class="highlight">“ambient
						assisted living”</span> for the elderly. A University of Manchester research group has developed
					smart carpeting that can tell when someone has fallen and that can even diagnose potential mobility
					problems from their footsteps.

				<h2>Exposed to Corporate Entities</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col text">
				<p>
					Added to this is the fact that the proliferation of smart, connected products will turn the home
					into a prime data collection node. It is estimated that there will be fifty billion wi-fi-connected
					devices by 2020, and all of them will collect data that is transmitted to and stored by their
					manufacturers. In short, <span class="highlight">the home is becoming a data factory.</span>
				</p>
				<p class="bolded-text">
					I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do. The most obvious and often-raised
					concerns about all of this, of course, have to do with privacy. The mass harvesting of our data and
					metadata may not be equivalent to inserting CCTV cameras in our homes, but it is a form of digital
					surveillance.
				</p>
				<p>
					One might ask whether we are returning to the ancient Greek notion of privacy that Hannah Arendt
					argued was not particularly private. That private realm was neither considered particularly noble.
					It was only centuries later that private property would offer “the only reliable hiding place from
					the common public world, not only from everything that goes on in it but also from its very
					publicity, from being seen and being heard.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here, the private becomes not exactly public but exposed to other private, corporate entities. The
					trade-off that the tech companies will offer us in exchange for the smart home is efficiency. And we
					the consumer will be willing accomplices for the simple reason that we are becoming very used to
					paying for services with our <span class="highlight">“free” data</span>—some of these products may even
					be supplied at next to no price in return for the data they produce.”

					<h4>My Response:</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="col text">
					<p>
						While the author argues that smart homes are less about convenience, but more about control and
						surveillance, I consider smart homes are not distortion, but continuation of one of the greatest
						achievements in humanity.
					<p class="bolded-text">
						For sure, this alarming mass data collection has countless dangers, so is its POTENTIAL.
					</p>
					<p>
						We can always whine about how the big tech companies are selling our data, and the fact that
						privacy is shrinking day by day. Though, let’s take a moment to reflect on its promise: voice
						assistants that let people with disabilities communicate with the world, smart locks that let
						parents check on if their children made home safely, and fall detectors that alert caregivers
						when an elderly parent is in danger. Needless to say, I gave only three examples.
					</p>
					<p>
						The mathematician Clive Humby noted back in 2006, <span class="highlight">“data is the new
							oil,</span> a resource that can be refined into immense value, but concentrated in the hands
						of those who control it.” Oil once gave us efficiency, wealth, and comfort but, in return, it
						left us pollution, dependency, and geopolitical conflict. Yet, no one argues we’d be better off
						without it. The air conditioning, which McGuirk claims inarguably one of the biggest domestic
						revolutions, is once built on the modern infrastructure fueled by “oil.” <br>
						<span class="highlight">A smart home has countless number of smarter benefits.</span> I believe it’s
						another industrial revolution, another moment when power shifts.
					</p>
					<p>
						And as always, the choice is to
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="blur">BE LEFT BEHIND</span>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="year">
						<span class="highlight">or ADAPT AND GO ON.</span>
